Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation?

With the proportional band (P) only, the PID controller output is proportional to the cte. It takes into account only the present value of cte. Thanks to this part of controller, it is able to steer in the correct direction.

Integral term (I) takes into account the integral of cte over the past time. It is used to reduce systematic bias. From my experianse of PID tuning on real-world systems and some experiments in the simulator, it was found out that we do not need to compute the integral for all time, but calculat it over only last n frames. In other case, we can accumulate errors because of left turns prevalens which can result in different behaviour of the controller during multi lap drive and even going off the track.

With derivative (D) part, the controller output is proportional to the rate of change of cte (its derivative). The parameter is used to reduce overshooting and dump oscillations caused by the P.



Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen?

Initially, the controller was tuned with so-called Zieglerâ€“Nichols method. Generally speaking, it requires to set Kd and Ki to 0 and gradually increase Kp before the car runs with stable and consistent oscillations. This value of Kp and the oscillation period can be used to calculate optimal pid controller parameters by the method. Unfortunatly, the controller with resulted parameters was able to drive car around the track but with a lot of wobbling. That is why, parameters were further tuned manually by try-and-error process.
